### Why is managing file ownership important in Linux?

1. **Security** : Protect sensitive data from unauthorized access or modification.
2. **Access Control** : The owner of a file or directory can set permissions dictating how other users can interact with the file, including reading, writing, and executing.
3. **Accountability** : By tracking file ownership, a system can maintain a log of who is making changes or adding files.

### Command to View File Ownership

The command to view file ownership (along with permissions) is `ls` with the `-l` option:

```bash
ls -l [file_name]
```

This command lists files in long format, which includes the file's permissions, number of links, owner name, owner group, size, timestamp, and filename.

### Permissions Set When Creating a File or Directory

When a user creates a file, the default permissions are usually `rw-rw-r--` for files and `rwxrwxr-x` for directories. These defaults can be modified by the system's `umask` value, which defines permissions that are "masked out" or not set by default.

-   Files are typically created without execute (`x`) permission because most files are not executable programs. Adding execute permissions by default could pose a security risk if not needed.
-   Directories are created with execute permission because, in Linux, the execute permission on a directory means the ability to access the contents of that directory, which is necessary for navigating into it (`cd` command).

### Changing Ownership of Files and Directories

The `chown` command is used to change the ownership of files and directories:

```bash
chown [new_owner]:[new_group] [file_or_directory]
```

-   `[new_owner]`: The username of the new owner.
-   `[new_group]`: The new group name. This part is optional; if omitted, only the owner will be changed.
-   `[file_or_directory]`: The name of the file or directory for which to change ownership.

Examples:

-   Change the owner of `file.txt` to `user1`: `chown user1 file.txt`
-   Change the owner and group of `directory` to `user2` and `group2`: `chown user2:group2 directory`

Changing the ownership of a file or directory is typically an operation that requires administrative privileges and is thus often preceded by `sudo` to gain superuser rights for the operation.
